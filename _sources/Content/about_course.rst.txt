This course provides an introduction to DevOps by covering both related technologies and software development practices. Additional information is available in the course syllabus. The course takes place entirely online and is mostly based on independent learning supported by both the provided material and the online modules.

The course material is available under the corresponding section in the Aalto MyCourses workspace of the course and consists of different types of curated resources, ranging from documents, videos, and other material freely available over the Internet. Hands-on resources to complete the project are available under tutorials.

Online modules include a project and questionnaires, the latter available through the A+ learning management system.
