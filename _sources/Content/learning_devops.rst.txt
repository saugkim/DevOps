1. Systems thinking: global optimization, faster as a whole
  - no defect to downstream work centers
  - no allow local optimizationi to create global degradation
  - increase flow
  
2. Feedback loop: Amplify and shorten Feedback Loops
  - page load times
  - measure throughput of work through the system
  - building right thing?
  - Metrics
  - Postmortems/learning reviews
    
3. Culture of Experimentation: continual experimentation and learning failure
  - allocating time for improvement of daily work
  - rewards for taking risks
  - introduce fault into system to increase resilience, site switching?
  
4. Principle of Kaizen: 
  - continuous improvement, getting better all the time
  - systems thinking
