Learn DevOps
===================

DevOps! What is it?
********************

DevOpss is a collaboration between development, operations and other teams with the recognition that we are tasked with achieving common business goals.

| **How to achieve?**
1. Systems thinking: global optimization, faster as a whole
  - no defect to downstream work centers
  - no allow local optimizationi to create global degradation
  - increase flow
  
2. Feedback loop: Amplify and shorten Feedback Loops
  - page load times
  - measure throughput of work through the system
  - building right thing?
  - Metrics
  - Postmortems/learning reviews
    
3. Culture of Experimentation: continual experimentation and learning failure
  - allocating time for improvement of daily work
  - rewards for taking risks
  - introduce fault into system to increase resilience, site switching?
  
4. Principle of Kaizen: 
  - continuous improvement, getting better all the time
  - systems thinking 
  - quality
  - process control
  - minimal inventory


CAMS model
-----------

| **Culture**
- service ownership
- hack events
- technical debt grooming 
- game days
- destructive testing (shutdown datacenter)
- cross functional teams
- agile 
Cargo culting? no!!

| **Automation**
- why automate? expensive, not scalable, more errors,  

- infrastructure as code - configuration management
- continuous delivery pipeline
- Simian army (?)
- Orchestration engine (?)

| **Measurement**
- why measure? metrics, monitoring, see data
- what to measure? cost?, revenue? how many signed up? how many calls? ...

- Instrumentation platform (Graphite, OpenTSDB ..)
- Information radiators (?)
- Process measurement (cycle time, MTTR, ...)


| **Sharing**  
- why sharing so important?
- visibility(everybody can see) + transparency(why you did) + knowledge transfer

- daily standup
- retrospectives 
- documentation 
- Brown bags/Tech talks/Internal conferences
- ChatOps -log, history


Continuous Delivery
---------------------
what is continuous delivery (CD)? what is continuous deployment? is same?

- system should be automated/repeatable
- run to the pain
- version controlled
- always deployable (working code)
- everyone's reponsibility

What CD systems looks like?
 - DO lots of small changes (Unit Tests), fast!
 - Unit Tests -> Integration Tests -> 
 - >> Security Tests >> Test Env A >> Test Env B
| everything went fine, humans can decide to push into production or not, but
|
Continuous deployment? if all tests passed through the continuous delivery pipelines, software automatically go into the production. 

Without continuous delivery, there is no continuous deployment.
