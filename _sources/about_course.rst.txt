Course CS-EJ4104
==================

About the course CS-EJ4104
****************************

A heading containing at least the text corresponding to the course code (i.e., CS-EJ4104). "Me and the CS-EJ4104 course" and "About CS-EJ4104" fulfill the requirement about the text in the heading. A few paragraphs or items in an unordered list immediately following the heading and describing why you decided to take this course and what you expected to learn. The related textual content should be between 250 and 500 words combined.

The word of DevOps was not familiar, be honest, I naver heard that before. I read the introduction of the course from FiTech, I do not remember well any more. I took this course because of the continuous deployment(or continuous integration) of software development. And my most interest at the moment is learning Deep Learning -python, tensorflow-, I train and upload trained model to web, test it and update the model when model is upgraded(that was my initial motive to select this course). 

Honestly I never expected to develop the website(If course instruction said that, I might not select this course). I have one website made with .rst documentation and sphinx, and one github pages with same source, no automation no workflow implemented but I am pretty satisfied with that. The fact that I design site structure without html knowledge, really good for me. On the other hand, this hugo, withoug html knowledge, I found that I really cannot do anything(remove all unnecessary decoration things-which each theme provides very proudly, no bug fixing skill when I tried to remove something) but adding posting into the selected theme.

I think I got the key idea of this continuous deployment workflow, at least Github Actions provides. And I am willing to learn more and deeply how to set this workflow syntax and yaml a bit, rather than just copy paste. The triggering continuos deployment from each master(or a specific branch)'s commit, is great. I never used github actions service before. I expect I am able to automate my workflow completely customized way. 

 - workflow syntax
 - event trigger
 - continuous integration
